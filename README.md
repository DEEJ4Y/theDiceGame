# theDiceGame
[theDiceGame](https://davidjosephind.github.io/theDiceGame/dicee.html) is one of the projects I have been working on as part of [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) course. theDiceGame is a website that displays my learnings in the JavaScript and Document Object Model (DOM) modules in the course. The skeleton project was provided by [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/). I was responsible for writing the JavaScript for the project.

The goal of this project was to understand the working of the Document Object Model (DOM) and implementation of JavaScript in websites.

## What I learnt

- JavaScript
- The Document Object Model (DOM)
- Selecting HTML Elements with JavaScript
- Manipulating and Changing styles of HTML Elements with JavaScript
- Text Content Property
- Manipulating HTML Element Attributes
